# NIfTI might store the TR in the header

```{python}
import numpy as np
# print arrays to 4 decimal places
np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)
import nibabel as nib
import nipraxis
```

The [NIfTI1 standard](http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1) suggests putting the
TR of a functional image, into the voxel dimension field of the header.

You can get the voxel (plus TR) dimensions with the `get_zooms` method of the
header object:

```{python}
func_fname = nipraxis.fetch_file('ds114_sub009_t2r1.nii')
func_img = nib.load(func_fname)
header = func_img.header
header.get_zooms()
```

In this case, the image spatial voxel sizes are (4 by 4 by 4)
millimeters, and the TR is 2.5 seconds.

In fact these values come from the NIfTI header field called `pixdim`:

```{python}
print(header)
```

Unfortunately, it is common for people writing NIfTI images not to write this
information correctly into the header, so we have to be careful, and very
suspicious, if the TR value appears to be 0 or 1.
